          Aiming to organize and present machine learning algorithms in a way that people can have a more intuitive understanding of what’s happening behind the scene, we introduce this visualization project that shows the decision boundaries generated by diﬀerent machine learning algorithms.

          It contains a 2D canvas such that new data points can be added and the boundary of a particular algorithm is adjusted accordingly. Along with the visualization, we have also included the corresponding tutorial for each algorithm. Since this is the design and development of an educational application, we will present many diﬀerent concepts and algorithms. Enjoy!

          P.S. This is primarily as our machine learning final project, but hopefully we will continue to add interesting stuff later on.
